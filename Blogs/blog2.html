    </header>

    <small>September 2020</small>

    <p>The dot com domain is one of the most popular and recognizable domains on the internet. It was originally created as a place for businesses to send emails to customers, but has evolved into much more than that.</p>
    <h2>What is the '.com' domain?</h2>
    <p>A domain name is the unique identifier for an internet site. '.com' is one of the most popular domain names available because it's short, easy to spell, and relatively easy for children to remember.</p>
    <h2>How did the '.com' domain get so popular?</h2>
    <p>The '.com' domain got so popular because it was the first top-level domain to be created. This means that people could have an address that was easier to remember because it only had one word.</p>
    <h2>Why do businesses use '.com' domain names?</h2>
    <p>'.com' is a domain extension that can be used by any company regardless of their physical location. The '.com' domain was created in 1985 and has been a top choice for businesses ever since.</p>
    <h2>The Future of the .Com Domain Name</h2>
    <p>The future of the .com domain name is uncertain. People have predicted that domain names will become more like phone numbers in the future, and it's possible that each website will need its own unique address (like a phone number). The .com domain name has been popular because it was easy to remember and people knew what they were getting when they typed it in.</p>
