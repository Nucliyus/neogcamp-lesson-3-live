        <h1 class="hero-heading"> NFTs are the Future of Gaming: An article about how NFTs are fundamentally changing gaming.</h1>
    </header>

    <small>September 2020</small>

 <p>With the rise of games like CryptoKitties, which made its debut in 2018, NFTs are trending this year. The game allows players to buy virtual cats that can then be purchased and sold on the marketplace. Players can also trade their digital "genes" so that their digital cat has desirable features. When you buy a CryptoKittie, you actually purchase an NFT token on the Ethereum blockchain, not just the cat itself.</p>
<h2>What are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)?</h2>
<p>Non-fungible tokens are a digitized, non-unique digital asset. Non-fungible tokens are unique to each individual user and have their own attributes which can be transferred between users. The token is not only limited to being something you own but it can also represent something you own. NFTs are often utilized as collectibles in which the token represents the physical object or character that is unique to that token holder, known as a “non-fungible good”</p>
<h2>NFTs and Community</h2>
<p>NFTs are a community-driven token. Many of the most successful NFTs have been used as a way to pay tribute to creators and entertainers. The tokens created for these games also include non-tangible items like stickers and pins, which can be given away by communities to show appreciation and support.</p>
<h2>Integrating NFTs with Popular Games</h2>
<p>There are a number of popular games that have already adopted NFTs into their gameplay. Some of the most successful games to adopt NFTs include Cryptokitties, Gods Unchained, and Etheremon.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this article has been helpful in answering your questions about NFTs and how they are changing the gaming industry as a whole.</p>
